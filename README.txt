
1. The test code for the following modules will alter databases, so please create backups before testing these modules:

- gameRent.py
- gameReturn.py
- inventoryPruning.py
- database.py

Above each module's test code is the list of databases that will be altered by the code.


2. I have populated all of the databases with my own data, so check the Subscription_Info database to see which customer IDs exist!
- The Game_Info database contains twenty games purchased in late August 2023, followed by 80 games purchased between
late August and early December 2023 in an effort to emulate a "starting stock" followed by continued purchases.
- The Rental database contains rentals between September 2023 and December 2023, with rentals for customers with valid subscriptions
at the time.

3. I hope you like my cycling list of unpopular games and my fancy graphs, they're my favourite part of the software :)
